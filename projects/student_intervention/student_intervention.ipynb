In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Other columns, like `Mjob` and `Fjob`, have more than two values, and are known as _categorical variables_. The recommended way to handle such a column is to create as many columns as possible values (e.g. `Fjob_teacher`, `Fjob_other`, `Fjob_services`, etc.), and assign a `1` to one of them and `0` to all others.\n",

Run the code cell below to perform the preprocessing routine discussed in this section."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decision Trees\n",
    "  - Application: [Spam Classification](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse573/04au/Project/mini2/Harsha/spam_classification.pdf)\n",
    "  - Strenghs: DTs have the ability to model complex decision boundries and have relatively strong interpretability because of the tree structure; they tend to have good performance in classification problems with limited class labels; DTs also perform well when predictors (features) are distributed evenly and the training process is properly regularized (pruned)\n",
    "  - Weakness: DTs has the tendency to overfit given data although there are ways to mitigate the effect (e.g. pruning); also, DTs are are, in nature, unstable - changing the input data could change the tree nodes a lot; they could perform poorly in many regression tasks\n",
    "  - Justifications: Since we are dealing with a binary classification problem with small number of features and all features are either values within small range or binary (including those dummy variables), I believe DTs would perform quite well;\n",
    "2. AdaBoost\n",
    "  - Application: [Gender Classification](http://vision.die.uchile.cl/files/42250068.pdf)<sup>[1]</sup>\n",
    "  - Strengths: AdaBoost, viewed from the exponential loss perspective, seems to guarantee good performace over iterations by combining weak learners to be trained on weighted training set; also, it is not prone to overfitting - it tends to increase margin value over iterations; it performs well in most cases;\n",
    "  - Weakness: [some](http://www.nickgillian.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/GRT/AdaBoost#Disadvantages) say AdaBoost is sensitive to noise data; it performs poorly (overfit) with choice of inappropriate weak learners;\n",
    "  - Justifications: Because of the provable accuracy of AdaBoost<sup>[2][3][4]</sup> in performing classification tasks.\n",
    "3. SVM\n",
    "  - Application: [Face Recognition](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiii4ar4_7QAhVIgLwKHUK_DvUQFggaMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fcbcl.mit.edu%2Fpublications%2Fps%2Ficcv2001.pdf&usg=AFQjCNEQ8MblXhUG3mnxHhr97k7FiGqiUg&sig2=tOcQiQji0NwF7cg8USq-hQ)<sup>[5]</sup>\n",
    "  - Strengths: By performing different kernel tricks, the training of SVM can incorporate domain-specific knowledge; the idea of SVM to maximize margins; it performs well with choice of good kernels and hyper parameters\n",
    "  - Weakness: Model selection and choice of hyper parameters could be difficult; SVM will perform poorly when kerenl function fails to represent similarities among data points in the hyper-dimension space;\n",
    "  - Justifications: SVM is able to capture complex relationships in feature space by applying kernel tricks\n",

Another property in the dual problem is that we can perform feature mapping, also called kernel tricks, to incorporate domain knowledge into the model. Suppose we have data points that cannot easily be separated by simply drawing a line (see below<sup>[7]</sup>).

    "Although it is no longer the same test set as before, applying stratification and feature scaling did improve the performance (F1 score) in the testing set: 0.7662 with feature scaling only and 0.8050 with both feature scaling and stratification. Notice that the original SVM has an F1 score of 0.7586. \n",

    "But stratification, rather than being an improvement of the model, is more of a trick to balance the dataset in order to better generalize the training results to the testing set. If given an independent testing set with different ratio of between the two classes, the technique might not be as useful as it was in the case above."
